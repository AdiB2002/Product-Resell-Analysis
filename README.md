# Product-Resell-Analysis
A collection of scripts from a project in which I aim to make money from reselling products and running analysis on the data. Firstly, I am scraping products that are on sale and scraping eBay to see if I can make a profit. However, this still requires some manual checking because that algorithm can't account for the uncertain nature of eBay. That's where I use machine learning (have the code to test multiple classification models) to hopefully increase the accuracy of my algorithm and reduce user input.
